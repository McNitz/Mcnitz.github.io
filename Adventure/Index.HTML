<h2 style="color:MediumSeaGreen;font-family:Courier">January 1, 2020</h2>
<p style= font-family:Arial> I met with Kim Jong Un in Pyongyang. The meeting was very brief. I go to shake his hand and take a picture or two with him. I also was able to ask him a few questions. A few of these included: When will you test some missles next?</p>

<h1 style="color:Tomato;font-family:Verdana;text-align:center;">My Trip to the DMZ</h1>
<h2 style="color:MediumSeaGreen;font-family:Courier">January 3, 2020</h2>
<p style= font-family:Arial> After meeting with Kim Jong Un, a few days later I headed down to the southeren border of North Korea also known as the DMZ. This place is the current border between South Korea and North Korea. There is a heavy military presence in the area so we had to be careful. We were and overall it was a very intriguing place to visit.</p>

<h1 style="color:Tomato;font-family:Verdana;text-align:center;">My adventure at the Ryugyong Hotel</h1>
<h2 style="color:MediumSeaGreen;font-family:Courier">January 5, 2020</h2>
<p style="font-family:Arial">Staying within the capital of Pyongyang, I visited the mysetrious Ryugyong Hotel. It is the tallst uncompleted strutcure in the world. It is 1,080ft tall with 105 floors! But, It has never had a single guest. The unique design was one of the various reasons why I wanted to visit it. Even though, it is not a functioning hotel it serves other purposes. Most of these include an amazing backdrop for propaganda messages. Overall, the Ryugyong hotel was a interesting and diverse experience.</p>

<p style= "font-family:Arial">After my visit to North Korea, I have learned alot about the mysetrious country. North Korea has some 대박 (awesome) landmarks. I beleive the rest of the world undervaules North Korea. The Norks (North Korean citizen) are quite friendly and proud of their nation. The most meaningful part of the trip was when I vistied the 38Th parrallel (where the DMZ is). It was interesting to see all the history in that area and how it is today as well. Overall, I deeply enjoyed my trip to North Korea and would recommend it highly even with the risks that come with it</p>
