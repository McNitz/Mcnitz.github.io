When the Europeans came across they had infrequent meetings with the natives. They later migrated out of south East Florida.<br>

Rail road owner to invest into Miami therefore making it a city even thought it had a bit over 300 people at the time.Miami saw major growth during the 1920s.<br>
This slowed a bit during the Great depression however. Miami came into importance during World War 2 because of its location in United States.<br>
 The last notable event to help boost Miami is when Fidel Castro took over cuba. This made plenty of Cuban Immigrants to come to Miami.</p>
